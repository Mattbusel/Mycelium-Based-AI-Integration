This repository explores the intersection of **synthetic biology** and **machine learning** by using **mycelium** — the root structure of fungi — as a living, bio-computational interface. The project aims to give AI systems a *body* by integrating ML models with the **adaptive, reactive properties of mycelium**, creating feedback systems that blur the line between living and artificial intelligence.

##  Project Goals

- **Develop a Bio-Computational Interface**  
  Leverage mycelium's natural ability to conduct signals and adapt to stimuli.

- **Create Bio-Electronic Feedback Loops**  
  Use microcontrollers and sensors to enable two-way communication between silicon and biology.

- **Train Adaptive ML Models**  
  Implement machine learning systems that interpret and influence biological growth and reactivity.

- **Enable Real-World Applications**  
  Explore integration into **robotics**, **environmental sensing**, and **adaptive materials**.

## Current Progress

###  Research & Exploration
- Analyzed mycelium’s signal-conducting and self-repairing properties.
- Surveyed existing literature on bio-computing and neuromorphic interfaces.

###  Prototyping
- **Phase 1**: Cultivating and testing signal conduction in mycelium samples.
- **Phase 2** *(in progress)*: Interfacing with sensors and microcontrollers.

###  Machine Learning Models
- Initial supervised and unsupervised ML models are being tested to classify and adapt to mycelium behavior.
