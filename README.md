# ycelium-Based-AI-Integration
This repository explores the intersection of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence by leveraging mycelium as a bio-computational substrate. The project aims to give AI systems a "body" by integrating machine learning models with the natural properties of mycelium, such as signal conduction, adaptive growth, and environmental reactivity.
