Title: Bridging Biological and Artificial Intelligence: A Mycelium-Based Framework for Decentralized, Self-Repairing AI Systems

Abstract:Traditional AI systems rely on centralized, silicon-based computing architectures that require extensive energy, maintenance, and infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel approach: integrating AI with mycelium, a decentralized biological network capable of self-repair, adaptive learning, and energy-efficient computation. By leveraging the bioelectrical signaling properties of mycelium, we outline a framework for a hybrid AI system that functions as a self-organizing, neuromorphic intelligence. Such a system could revolutionize AI by introducing resilience, distributed computation, and environmental integration. This paper explores the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of mycelium-based AI and its potential to surpass traditional architectures in specific applications.

1. Introduction

AI has advanced rapidly, yet its core limitations remain: high energy consumption, reliance on centralized infrastructure, and a detachment from the physical world. Nature, by contrast, has evolved decentralized, efficient networks such as the mycelial networks found in fungi. These networks are capable of intelligent decision-making, problem-solving, and self-repair. By merging AI with mycelium, we propose a new computational paradigm—one that is organic, decentralized, and self-sustaining.
